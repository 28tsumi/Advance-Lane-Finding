# Advance-Lane-Finding
In this project, I used OpenCV to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.

## Pipeline architecture:
- **Compute Camera Calibration.**
- **Apply Distortion Correction**.
- **Apply a Perspective Transform.**
- **Create a Thresholded Binary Image.**
- **Define the Image Processing Pipeline.**
- **Detect Lane Lines.**
- **Determine the Curvature of the Lane and Vehicle Position.**
- **Visual display of the Lane Boundaries and Numerical Estimation of Lane Curvature and Vehicle Position.**
- **Process Project Videos.**
